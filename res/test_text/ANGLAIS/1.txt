French President Emmanuel Macron has led the global condemnation of Saturday's terror attack in London which left seven people dead.
A French citizen was among those killed, the foreign ministry says. The dozens of people injured also included four French nationals.
Mr Macron spoke by phone with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and said France was "more than ever at Britain's side".
A Canadian citizen was killed, and two Germans were injured, one critically.
No names of those killed have been released.
"I am heartbroken that a Canadian is among those killed," Mr Trudeau said in a statement, saying Canada stood with the UK.
Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his "prayers and resolute solidarity" were with the British. Two Australians were affected, he said.
One was in hospital, while the authorities were working to determine the status of the second person, Mr Turnbull told a news conference.Mr Macron was one of the first world leaders to react to the events.
"In the face of this new tragedy, France is more than ever at Britain's side. My thoughts go out to the victims and their loved ones."
France "will continue to fight terrorism with all its powers, alongside the United Kingdom and all affected countries", he said.
The presidential office described the London attack as a "new abominable, cowardly attack on our free societies".
France has experienced several attacks in recent months, including a deadly shooting on the Champs-Elysees days before its presidential elections, and a machete attack outside the Louvre Museum.
The lights on the Eiffel Tower in Paris will be turned off on Sunday night in a gesture of solidarity.
'United in horror'
US, European and Commonwealth leaders have also rallied around the UK.
