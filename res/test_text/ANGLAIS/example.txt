Russian reports that a release of chemicals that killed and injured dozens of civilians in northern Syria came from rebel weapons on the ground have been rejected.
The UK's foreign secretary, a rebel commander and a weapons expert all said the evidence pointed to an attack by Syrian government forces.
Damascus denies its forces launched a chemical weapons attack.
The issue is overshadowing a conference on Syria in Brussels.
Seventy donor nations are discussing aid efforts in the war-ravaged country. The UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stephen O'Brien, said details of new pledges would be released later on Wednesday.
Syria chemical 'attack': What now?
The UN Security Council is due to hold emergency talks later following the release of gas in Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province.
According to UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 20 children and 52 adults were killed.
What happened?
Footage from Khan Sheikhoun following the incident on Tuesday showed civilians, many of them children, choking and foaming at the mouth.
Witnesses say clinics treating the injured were then targeted by air strikes.

Some of the victims were treated across the border in Turkey. One woman in hospital said: "We were affected by the gas. We couldn't stand up. I felt dizzy and sick. I suffer from shortness of breath. I couldn't breathe."
